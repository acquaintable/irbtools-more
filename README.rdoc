= irbtools-more

irbtools[http://github.com/janlelis/irbtools] is a meta gem which installs some useful irb gems and configures your irb.

<tt>irbtools-more</tt> adds some more irb gems which may not build out-of-the-box. Currently included: better auto completion and an object inspector.

== Setup

  gem install irbtools-more
  gem install irb_rocket --source http://merbi.st
  
* On Linux, you also need the +xclip+ program (apt-get install xclip).
* On MacOS, you need growl, if you want to use the +g+ gem.
* You need +tk+ for DrX (maybe try <tt>tk_as_gem</tt>)

== Usage

To use it, put the following in your <tt>~/.irbrc</tt> file (this file is loaded everytime you start an irb):

  require 'rubygems' # only needed in 1.8
  require 'irbtools-more'

If it does not exist, just create a new one.

It's possible to modify, which libraries get loaded:

  require 'irbtools/configure'
  Irbtools.add_package :more # adds this extension package
  # here you can edit which libraries get loaded. See the irbtools README for details.
  Irbtools.start

You could also just use the base +irbtools+ and add the additional gems yourself.
